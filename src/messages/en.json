As Frontend Architect and Team Lead at VELA, I defined the Micro Frontend strategy using Nx (one host, multiple remotes), established CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes, and led 8 frontend developers across a 60-person program. I focus on reusable components, performance, and clear ownership so that multiple portals and tenants can evolve in parallel. My background spans Angular and React/Next.js, multi-tenant logistics platforms, e-commerce, and fullstack delivery—always with an eye on maintainability and measurable impact."
